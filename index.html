        <p>They are classified in the order Pilosa because they are related to anteaters, which sport a similar set of specialized claws. Extinct sloth species include many megafaunal ground sloths, some of which attained the size of elephants, as well as a few species of marine sloths. Extant sloths are medium-sized arboreal (tree-dwelling) residents of the jungles of Central and South America. Sloths make good habitats for other organisms, and a single sloth may be home to moths, beetles, cockroaches, fungi, ciliates, and algae.</p>

        <h2>The three-toed sloths are arboreal neotropical mammals (also known as “three-fingered” sloths)</h2>

        <p>The three-toed sloths are arboreal neotropical mammals (also known as “three-fingered” sloths) Famously slow-moving, a sloth travels at an average speed of 0.24 km/h. Three-toed sloths are about the size of a small dog or a large cat, with the head and body having a combined length around 45 cm and a weight of 3.5–4.5 kg. Unlike the two-toed sloths, they also have short tails of 6–7 cm, and they have three clawed toes on each limb. All sloths have three digits on their hindlimbs; the difference is found in the number of digits on the forelimbs; thus they are sometimes referred to as three-fingered sloths.</p>
